Cellular Automaton
==================

This is the Cellular Automaton - a system enabling you to simulate and visualise sort of cellular automatons:
- Game of Life (with Quad Life)
- one dimensional games (Rule 30 etc.)
- Langton Ant
- Wire World
- and their variations...

Game of Life
------------

Game of Life is the most popular cellular automaton. It lets you simulate many amazing configurations depending on simple rules.
The are really many possible rules in classic Game of Life (2^18 = 262144) but below are listed some interesting ones:

| Rule | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| /2 | Seeds | Intense, chaotic growth. |
| /234 | Tray cloths | Resembles laces, tray cloths. |
| 012345678/1 |  | Wolfram – 7(e). |
| 012345678/3 | Life without death | Patterns resemble ladders. |
| 012345678/378 |  | Wolfram – 9(a). |
| 01356/13456 |  | Wolfram – 7(d). |
| 018/018 |  | Wolfram. |
| 0238/123567 |  | Wolfram – 13(f), class 3. |
| 03456/34 |  | Wolfram – 7(g). |
| 045/0578 |  | Wolfram – 7(i). |
| 0468/236 |  | Wolfram – 7(a), 13(g), class 3. |
| 1/1 | Growth | Developed by Kellie Evans. Creates interesting forms, starts even from a single cell. |
| 12345/3 | Maze | Creates patterns resembling mazes. |
| 12456/0578 |  | Wolfram – 7(h). |
| 125/36 | 2x2 | Has many oscillators and ships. |
| 135/135 |  | Wolfram – 13(h), class 3. |
| 1357/1357 | Replicator | Replicating automaton by Edward Fredkin. Every single structure is being replaced by a couple of its copies within time. |
| 1358/357 | Amoeba | Well balanced between life and death. Has ships. |
| 23/3 | Conway's Game of Life | Very complex behaviour.
| 23/36 | HighLife | Similar to Conway's Game of Life (some of its structures works in HighLife), self-replicating structure. |
| 234/3 |  | Wolfram – 9(b), 13(b), class 2. Has ships. |
| 2345/45678 | Cities surrounded by wall | Creates active centers surrounded by static walls. |
| 2346/367 |  | Wolfram – 9(c). Has ships. |
| 235678/3678 | Mark | Fast stabilising structures. |
| 235678/378 | Coagulation | Patterns expand as opposed to Marks. |
| 238/357 | Pseudolife | Evolution resembles 23/3 but only a few pattern from Game of Life works here. |
| 245/368 | Motion | Random structures are stabilising usually but many ships appear often and naturally. |
| 27/257 |  | Wolfram – 7(b). Has ships. |
| 34/34 | Three Four | Some greater patterns explode. Ships and many tiny oscillators. |
| 34678/3678 | Day and Night | Many patterns having complex behaviour. Inverted patterns work same as not inverted (inverted means living cells changed to dead cells and vice versa). |
| 4567/345 | Assimilation | Creates statistical structures resembling diamonds partly filled inside. |
| 45678/137 |  | Wolfram – 7(f). |
| 45678/3 | Coral | Patterns grow slowly, forming structures resembling coral reef. |
| 5/345 | Long Life | Rule developed by Andrew Trevorrow. It's easy to find long period oscillators. |
| 5678/35678 | Diamoeba | Creates huge concrete structures with chaotically oscillating borders. |
